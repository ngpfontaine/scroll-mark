# Scroll Mark

### Problem
Often, it's easy to lose your place on a webpage when scrolling - especially text-heavy pages without obtrusive anchors. Generally you relocate your position quickly, but it's an unnecessary annoyance. Smooth-scrolling homogenizes everything while moving, often resulting in eye flickering/strain. Non smooth-scrolling prevents this, but makes large jumps which can throw off focus.

### Solution
Animate a visual anchor to help positional tracking

### How
The webpage body will automatically use the scroll mark if it's tall enough to overflow-y. Or add `.scroll-mark` class to elements you want to use it.
